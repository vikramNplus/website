We supply colour boards compatible with various printhead technologies including Konica Minolta, Starfire, and Epson. These boards feature advanced circuitry that provides stable voltage regulation to the printheads, protecting them from power fluctuations. Over time, head boards can degrade due to ink mist exposure or electrical surges, leading to missing nozzles or complete channel failure. Replacing an aging or faulty colour board can dramatically improve print consistency and resolve issues like "ghosting" or random firing.

Our boards come with enhanced protective coatings to resist corrosion from solvent inks. They are rigorously tested for signal integrity and thermal stability. Whether you are running a 4-head or an 8-head setup, we have the right board to match your machine configuration. We also provide guidance on dip switch settings and cable connections to ensure a hassle-free installation process.`,

    name: 'Encoder Film / Raster Strip',
    shortDescription: 'High-precision linear encoder strip for accurate carriage positioning.',
    longDescription: `The Encoder Film (or Raster Strip) is the ruler by which your large format printer measures distance. It works in tandem with the encoder sensor to tell the machine exactly where the carriage is at any given millisecond. A clean and undamaged encoder strip is vital for print alignment; even a small scratch or ink smudge can cause the carriage to get lost, resulting in "stair-step" printing, blurred images, or error messages.

Our encoder films are manufactured with high-precision optical lithography, ensuring distinct and accurate grating lines (typically 180 LPI). Made from durable, dimensionally stable polyester material, they resist stretching and warping due to temperature changes. We offer strips in various lengths to suit machines ranging from 6 feet to 10 feet and beyond.

Regular cleaning is required, but eventually, every strip needs replacement. If your vertical lines are not straight or your bidirectional printing is impossible to align, a new encoder strip is often the solution. Our strips are easy to install and come with protective layers to ensure they reach you in perfect condition.`,

    shortDescription: 'Regulates ink pressure and supply to the printhead.',
    longDescription: `The Ink Subtank serves as a critical buffer between the main ink tanks and the delicate printheads. Its primary role is to maintain a constant level of ink and a stable pressure, ensuring that the printhead always has a ready supply of ink without being flooded or starved. This is essential for consistent ink flow, especially during high-speed printing where demand fluctuates rapidly.

Our subtanks are equipped with high-quality stainless steel mesh filters that trap any final debris or sediment before the ink enters the head, providing a last line of defense for your expensive printheads. They also feature reliable float level sensors (for machines with electronic systems) or mechanical valves to control ink intake automatically.

Made from solvent-resistant, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or similar robust materials, our subtanks are designed to withstand the harsh chemical properties of solvent and UV inks. We stock various shapes and capacities to fit different machine models, including those for Konica, Seiko, and Starfire heads.`,

    shortDescription: 'Durable micro-diaphragm pumps for ink supply and cleaning.',
    longDescription: `Reliable pumps are the workhorses of any fluid delivery system in a digital printer. We offer high-quality micro-diaphragm pumps used for both ink supply (moving ink from main tank to subtank) and for cleaning/purging stations. These pumps are designed to handle aggressive fluids like solvent inks, UV inks, and cleaning solutions without degrading.

Our pumps feature robust motors and chemically resistant diaphragms that ensure a long operational life. They provide consistent flow rates and pressure, which is crucial for the automated refilling systems to work correctly. A failing pump can lead to ink starvation or, in the case of cleaning pumps, ineffective head cleaning which can cause nozzle clogs.

We stock pumps with various voltage ratings (24V DC is standard) and flow capacities (100ml/min to 300ml/min or more). Whether you need a small ink pump or a larger air pump for positive pressure systems, we have the right component for your machine.`,
